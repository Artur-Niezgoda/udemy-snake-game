# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Turtle graphics library in Python. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing in length. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or with its own body.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Run `main.py` to start the game.
3. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
4. Eat as much food as possible to increase your score and grow your snake.
5. Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body, or the game will end.

## Files

- `main.py`: contains the main game loop and sets up the game window.
- `food.py`: defines the Food class, which creates the food objects that the snake eats.
- `snake.py`: defines the Snake class, which creates the snake and handles its movement and collision detection.
- `border.py`: defines the Border class, which creates the game border.

## Dependencies

This game requires Python 3 and the Turtle graphics library, which is included in the standard library.
